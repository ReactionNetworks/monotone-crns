To run the monotone CRN search, follow these steps:

1. Install Sage, if you haven't already. Sage 6.2rc or higher is strongly recommended,
   as there is a memory leak in the function Cone.dual() in earlier versions of Sage,
   which is used in the main loop of the CRN search.

2. Make sure that the Sage binary is in your PATH environment variable.

3. Edit the compile script, ensuring that SAGEPYTHON points to the correct location of
   the Python binary in your Sage install.

4. Compile the Python libraries by running './compile'.

5. Optionally, create your own .ini file by copying one of the existing ones.

6. Launch the script with './crn.sage <inifile>', or run through several ini files
   sequentially using a script like the example below.

#!/bin/sh
for i in 3d*.ini
do
	LOGFILE=$(echo "$i" | cut -d . -f 1).log
	./crn.sage "$i" > $LOGFILE
done
